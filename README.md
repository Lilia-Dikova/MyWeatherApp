   - Dynamically updates the weather icon based on current mode.

2. **Weather Data**:
   - Fetches data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
   - Displays:
     - City name
     - Temperature
     - Min/Max temperature
     - Weather description
     - Wind speed
     - Humidity
     - Visibility

3. **Search Input**:
   - Pressing `Enter` or clicking the search button fetches data.
   - Error handling for invalid city names.
